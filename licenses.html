=======

pugixml is a C++ XML processing library, which consists of a DOM-like interface with rich traversal/modification
capabilities, an extremely fast XML parser which constructs the DOM tree from an XML file/buffer, and an XPath 1.0
implementation for complex data-driven tree queries. Full Unicode support is also available, with Unicode interface
variants and conversions between different Unicode encodings (which happen automatically during parsing/saving).

pugixml is used by a lot of projects, both open-source and proprietary, for performance and easy-to-use interface.

## Documentation

Documentation for the current release of pugixml is available on-line as two separate documents:

* [Quick-start guide](https://pugixml.org/docs/quickstart.html), that aims to provide enough information to start using the library;
* [Complete reference manual](https://pugixml.org/docs/manual.html), that describes all features of the library in detail.

You’re advised to start with the quick-start guide; however, many important library features are either not described in it at all or only mentioned briefly; if you require more information you should read the complete manual.

## Example

Here&#39;s an example of how code using pugixml looks; it opens an XML file, goes over all Tool nodes and prints tools that have a Timeout attribute greater than 0:

```c++
#include &quot;pugixml.hpp&quot;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    pugi::xml_document doc;
    pugi::xml_parse_result result = doc.load_file(&quot;xgconsole.xml&quot;);
    if (!result)
        return -1;
        
    for (pugi::xml_node tool: doc.child(&quot;Profile&quot;).child(&quot;Tools&quot;).children(&quot;Tool&quot;))
    {
        int timeout = tool.attribute(&quot;Timeout&quot;).as_int();
        
        if (timeout &gt; 0)
            std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Tool &quot; &lt;&lt; tool.attribute(&quot;Filename&quot;).value() &lt;&lt; &quot; has timeout &quot; &lt;&lt; timeout &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;;
    }
}
```

And the same example using XPath:

```c++
#include &quot;pugixml.hpp&quot;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    pugi::xml_document doc;
    pugi::xml_parse_result result = doc.load_file(&quot;xgconsole.xml&quot;);
    if (!result)
        return -1;
        
    pugi::xpath_node_set tools_with_timeout = doc.select_nodes(&quot;/Profile/Tools/Tool[@Timeout &gt; 0]&quot;);
    
    for (pugi::xpath_node node: tools_with_timeout)
    {
        pugi::xml_node tool = node.node();
        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Tool &quot; &lt;&lt; tool.attribute(&quot;Filename&quot;).value() &lt;&lt;
            &quot; has timeout &quot; &lt;&lt; tool.attribute(&quot;Timeout&quot;).as_int() &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;;
    }
}
```

[utf8proc](http://juliastrings.github.io/utf8proc/) is a small, clean C
library that provides Unicode normalization, case-folding, and other
operations for data in the [UTF-8
encoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).  It was [initially
developed](http://www.public-software-group.org/utf8proc) by Jan
Behrens and the rest of the [Public Software
Group](http://www.public-software-group.org/), who deserve *nearly all
of the credit* for this package.  With the blessing of the Public
Software Group, the [Julia developers](http://julialang.org/) have
taken over development of utf8proc, since the original developers have
moved to other projects.

utf8proc is used for basic Unicode
support in the [Julia language](http://julialang.org/), and the Julia
developers became involved because they wanted to add Unicode 7 support and other features; it is now regularly updated to keep up with recent Unicode releases.

There are also utf8proc wrappers for [Ruby](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/projects/utf8_proc) and [Rust](https://docs.rs/utf8proc/latest/utf8proc/) ([github](https://github.com/Techcable/utf8proc.rs)).  (The original utf8proc package also included PostgreSQL bindings.)

The utf8proc package is licensed under the
free/open-source [MIT &quot;expat&quot;
license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) (plus certain Unicode
data governed by the similarly permissive [Unicode data
license](http://www.unicode.org/copyright.html#Exhibit1)); please see
the included `LICENSE.md` file for more detailed information.

## Quick Start

Typical users should download a [utf8proc release](http://juliastrings.github.io/utf8proc/releases/) rather than cloning directly from github.

For compilation of the C library, run `make`.  You can also install the library and header file with `make install` (by default into `/usr/local/lib` and `/usr/local/bin`, but this can be changed by `make prefix=/some/dir`).  `make check` runs some tests, and `make clean` deletes all of the generated files.

Alternatively, you can compile with `cmake`, e.g. by
```sh
mkdir build
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

### Using other compilers
The included `Makefile` supports GNU/Linux flavors and MacOS with `gcc`-like compilers; Windows users will typically use `cmake`.

For other Unix-like systems and other compilers, you may need to pass modified settings to `make` in order to use the correct compilation flags for building shared libraries on your system.

For HP-UX with HP&#39;s `aCC` compiler and GNU Make (installed as `gmake`), you can compile with
```
gmake CC=/opt/aCC/bin/aCC CFLAGS=&quot;+O2&quot; PICFLAG=&quot;+z&quot; C99FLAG=&quot;-Ae&quot; WCFLAGS=&quot;+w&quot; LDFLAG_SHARED=&quot;-b&quot; SOFLAG=&quot;-Wl,+h&quot;
```
To run `gmake install` you will need GNU coreutils for the `install` command, and you may want to pass `prefix=/opt libdir=/opt/lib/hpux32` or similar to change the installation location.

### Using with CMake

A CMake Config-file package is provided. To use utf8proc in a CMake project:

```cmake
add_executable (app app.c)
find_package (utf8proc 2.9.0 REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries (app PRIVATE utf8proc::utf8proc)
```

## General Information

The C library is found in this directory after successful compilation
and is named `libutf8proc.a` (for the static library) and
`libutf8proc.so` (for the dynamic library).

The Unicode version supported is 17.0.0.

For Unicode normalizations, the following options are used:

* Normalization Form C:  `STABLE`, `COMPOSE`
* Normalization Form D:  `STABLE`, `DECOMPOSE`
* Normalization Form KC: `STABLE`, `COMPOSE`, `COMPAT`
* Normalization Form KD: `STABLE`, `DECOMPOSE`, `COMPAT`

## C Library

The documentation for the C library is found in the `utf8proc.h` header file.
`utf8proc_map` is function you will most likely be using for mapping UTF-8
strings, unless you want to allocate memory yourself.

## To Do

See the Github [issues list](https://github.com/JuliaLang/utf8proc/issues).

## Contact

Bug reports, feature requests, and other queries can be filed at
the [utf8proc issues page on Github](https://github.com/JuliaLang/utf8proc/issues).

## See also

An independent Lua translation of this library, [lua-mojibake](https://github.com/differentprogramming/lua-mojibake), is also available.

## Examples

### Convert codepoint to string
```c
// Convert codepoint `a` to utf8 string `str`
utf8proc_int32_t a = 223;
utf8proc_uint8_t str[16] = { 0 };
utf8proc_encode_char(a, str);
printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, str);
// ß
```

### Convert string to codepoint
```c
// Convert string `str` to pointer to codepoint `a`
utf8proc_uint8_t str[] = &quot;ß&quot;;
utf8proc_int32_t a;
utf8proc_iterate(str, -1, &amp;a);
printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, a);
// 223
```

### Casefold

```c
// Convert &quot;ß&quot;  (U+00DF) to its casefold variant &quot;ss&quot;
utf8proc_uint8_t str[] = &quot;ß&quot;;
utf8proc_uint8_t *fold_str;
utf8proc_map(str, 0, &amp;fold_str, UTF8PROC_NULLTERM | UTF8PROC_CASEFOLD);
printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, fold_str);
// ss
free(fold_str);
```

### Normalization Form C/D (NFC/NFD)
```c
// Decompose &quot;\u00e4\u00f6\u00fc&quot; = &quot;äöü&quot; into &quot;a\u0308o\u0308u\u0308&quot; (= &quot;äöü&quot; via combining char U+0308)
utf8proc_uint8_t input[] = {0xc3, 0xa4, 0xc3, 0xb6, 0xc3, 0xbc}; // &quot;\u00e4\u00f6\u00fc&quot; = &quot;äöü&quot; in UTF-8
utf8proc_uint8_t *nfd= utf8proc_NFD(input); // = {0x61, 0xcc, 0x88, 0x6f, 0xcc, 0x88, 0x75, 0xcc, 0x88}

// Compose &quot;a\u0308o\u0308u\u0308&quot; into &quot;\u00e4\u00f6\u00fc&quot; (= &quot;äöü&quot; via precomposed characters)
utf8proc_uint8_t *nfc= utf8proc_NFC(nfd);

free(nfd);
free(nfc);
```
